          <h2>What is Git & Github?</h2>
          <p>Git or GitHub. Are they the same thing? If not, are they connected in some way? Or, like Java and JavaScript, is the connection only superficial? </p>
          <p>These questions are definitely worth asking. After all, Microsoft was willing to shell out $7.5 billion dollars to acquire GitHub back in 2018, so developers of all skill levels should be sitting up and taking notice. But the truth is that Git and GitHub are connected much more closely than Java and JavaScript — but with some key differences setting them apart.</p>
          <p>What’s the difference between Git and GitHub? Well, to answer that, let's take a look at the picture below.</p>
          <img src="https://devmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gitvs_Github-1a-1.jpg">

          <p>GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.</p>
          <p>A quick aside: git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred to in git-speak as “remotes”, and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.</p>

          <h5>Follow the following steps to get started with git and github:</h5>
          
         <h4><span class="text-success">Step 1: Install git and create a GitHub account </span></h4>
         <p>The first two things you'll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account.</p>
         <p>Follow the instructions <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a> to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command. A note: 95% of other online git resources and discussions will also be for the command-line interface. </p>
         <p>Once you've done that, create a GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>.</p>

         <h4><span class="text-success">Step 2: Create a local git repository  </span></h4>
         <p>When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">repository</a> (or often, 'repo', for short). </p>
         <p>To use git we'll be using the terminal. If you don't have much experience with the terminal and basic commands, check out this tutorial (If you don’t want/ need a short history lesson, skip to step three.) </p>
         <p>To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the cd (change directory) command.</p>
         <p>To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the git init command: </p>

         <h4><span class="text-success">Step 3: Add a new file to the repo </span></h4>
         <p>Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like. </p>
         <p>Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that  the file exists inside the repo. But, git won't track the file unless you explicitly tell it to. Git only saves/manages changes to files that it tracks, so we’ll need to send a command to confirm that yes, we want git to track our new file.</p>
         <p>After creating the new file, you can use the git status command to see which files git knows exist.</p>
         <p>What this basically says is, "Hey, we noticed you created a new file called mnelson.txt, but unless you use the 'git add' command we aren't going to do anything with it." </p>

         <h4><span class="text-success">Step 4: Add a file to the staging environment</span></h4>
         <p>Add a file to the staging environment using the git add command. </p>
         <p>If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the "Changes to be committed" line). </p>
         <p>To reiterate, the file has not yet been added to a commit, but it's about to be.</p>

         <h4><span class="text-success">Step 5: Create a commit</span></h4>
         <p>It's time to create your first commit!</p>
         <p>Run the command git commit -m "Your message about the commit" </p>
         <p>The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it's a new feature, maybe it's a bug fix, maybe it's just fixing a typo. Don't put a message like "asdfadsf" or "foobar". That makes the other people who see your commit sad. Very, very, sad. Commits live forever in a repository (technically you can delete them if you really, really need to but it’s messy), so if you leave a clear explanation of your changes it can be extremely helpful for future programmers (perhaps future you!) who are trying to figure out why some change was made years later.</p>
